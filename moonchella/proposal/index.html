      <h1>Midterm Project Proposal</h1>
        <p><b>Tina, Kat, & Junyang</b></p>
        <p>For our midterm project, we have decided to create an endless-runner style game that can both be played on desktop and mobile. The theme of the game is getting different musicians to collect various clothing items and avoid hitting obstacles while hoverboarding their way to Coachella 2020 on the moon. 
        <br><br> 
        The player will be able to select their starting character which will vary the items that  will appear on the screen. The character will be controlled by mouse presses, where one click will allow the character to capture an object while clicking and dragging the mouse will move the character up and down. If the character hits an obstacle, they will be sent back to the start and lose all of their items. Once the character has reached the end, the player will be prompted to play again with a different character in order to add them to the final Coachella lineup. When all of the characters have reached the end, they will play a short concert on the moon.
        <br><br>
        We are choosing to pursue this project we like music, the memphis/vaporwave aesthetics, and want to build a game that can be played both on mobile and desktop browsers.
        </p>
      
      <h2>Inspo Screen shots</h2>
        <p>Our concept of the game is inspired by an IOS game called <em>Alternate</em> developed by Hector Drandakis, where Edison tosses lightning bolts at Tesla while Tesla has to fly and avoid said bolts.</p>
