        vegetable in New Zealand, a 7.5m (25ft) fiberglass sculpture first installed in 1984 for a commercial. Ohakune
        was home to many Chinese market gardens (p.54) in the early to mid-1900s, producing almost half of the North
        Island’s vegetables at its peak and served as the base for the government’s vegetable production scheme during
        WWII. Today, Ohakune produces two-thirds of the carrot crops in the North Island, and is known as New Zealand’s
        Carrot Capital.</div>

        to the Rakaia River, which was known for being a salmon and trout destination. Chinook salmon (also known as
        Quinnat salmon) were first released in Rakaia River in the early 1900s, and New Zealand remains the only place
        in the world where these salmon have established a self-sustaining population outside their natural range.</div>

            A small zine about Big Things—giant statues around Aotearoa.
            <br><br>
            There are a lot of Big Things in New Zealand. From large fruits to gargantuan animals, these oversized
            sculptures dot the country landscape, often acting as roadside attractions or small town markers. These Big
            Things are at times nostalgic and at times absurd, but always embody the unique kitschiness of kiwiana. As
            they are blown up beyond proportions, they become integrated with the landscape, quite literally marking
            territory and monumentizing imagined identities.
