      Senior Week is an NYU tradition held every year for matriculating seniors. It consists of a week of events and celebrations, ending with a big ball leading up to graduation.
      As the VP of marketing of the <a href="../pages/CAB.html">Class of 2020 Activities Board</a>, I was tasked with designing and creating all marketing materials for 2020's Senior Week.
      <br><br>
      I had a lot of freedom design-wise at NYUâ€”as long as there was nothing inappropraite, everything pretty much gets approved without much revision. 
      For this design, I ditched the traditional themes and went experimental. At the time, I was really interested in exploring all the trends in graphic design, and so the result is definitely a reflection of that.
      Looking back now, there was maybe too much going on as I wanted to incorporate <i>everything</i>. But I do like how it looks now as a representation of me in my final college year: a coagulation of unsatiated yearning and a wavering, unrefined bluntness.
