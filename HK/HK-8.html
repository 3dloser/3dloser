      I ended up going to high school in England in 2014, where there were not a lot of Asian students; For most of us, our heritage traced back to either Hong Kong or mainland China.

      We were all pretty close, but it was almost an unspoken rule that no one ever consciously brought up politics. Deep down in our hearts, we knew that many of us held very different opinions, the same ones that lead us to the events that unraveled today; but for now, just for now, we didn’t need to find out. This was the only place we could be close, miles and miles away from home.
