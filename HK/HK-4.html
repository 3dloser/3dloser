      <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Cantonese as a political language</span>
      <br><br>
      My mum would always tell me, “don’t try to speak Cantonese at school! People will laugh at you because you have an accent.” My mum was from a rural Cantonese-speaking city, 湛江 (Zhan Jiang), and they spoke with an accent that’s considered very hick. My dad’s side of the family never quite liked my mum because of her accent, as it wasn’t “pure” Cantonese. Terrified of me and my sisters inheriting her accent, my mum never spoke Cantonese to me and my sisters growing up; It took us years to unlearn the accent and convert to canonical Cantonese.
      <br><br>
      We lived in Guangzhou, a metropolitan city nestled in the Southern Canton region of China where Cantonese was born. In school, there has been an unspoken hierarchy ever since I remembered: if you spoke Cantonese, you were instantly superior to the kids who only spoke Mandarin. My school had a good mix of Cantonese locals, Hong Kongers, and out of state mainlanders. We were mandated to speak Mandarin in Class, but the moment the recess bell rings, the Cantonese speakers break out in Cantonese chatter.  If you were from Northern China or any non-Cantonese speaking city, you would be made fun of as “捞“ (lao), frequently left out of conversations and inside jokes. 
      <br><br>
      As I grew up, I notice the tension extends beyond Guangzhou. Having travelled to Hong Kong frequently to visit relatives, I witnessed first hand the difference between Cantonese and Mandarin speakers. As a Cantonese speaker, even if you’re from the mainland, you blend in perfectly and will be treated as one of their own (especially if you’re from Guangzhou, the birth place of Cantonese and commonly regarded as the most authentic/standard Cantonese on par with Hong Kong Cantonese); however, if you’re a Mandarin-speaking mainland visitor, you are often blatantly ignored--or more often, a disdained eye roll before a response with shaky Mandarin. It is common knowledge that you would much rather speak English or, hell, pretend you’re Japanese or Korean, before trying to communicate with locals in Mandarin.
      <br><br>
      Now even living in New York, the ability to switch between Mandarin and Cantonese has afforded me countless benefits in Chinatown when I go yum cha or grocery shopping. I remember a particular incident that was quite comical--I was in line to check out, and the cashier was finishing an order for the customer in front of me. The customer was a mainlander, and the cashier was visibly displeased, impatiently telling the customer to hurry up in broken Mandarin. When it came to my turn, her facial expressions suddenly softened to a smile as I spoke to her in Cantonese. She took out her secret stash of plastic bags (which is banned in New York) and offered them for my groceries. I thanked her for the kind, albeit illegal, gesture, and told her I had a tote bag. 
      <br><br>
      That’s the thing about language. Anywhere in the world, theres is an affinity among those who speak the same language. Walking away, I remember being so grateful to be a Cantonese speaker, as it affords me perks and kinship with strangers around the world--but it is becoming increasingly undeniable that Cantonese extends beyond kinship, beyond exclusivity, and into the territory of segregation. 
      <br><br>
      Language as the medium, the message is a passive-aggressive tug of war. Cantonese pop singers will be accused of “selling out” if they release EPs or albums in Mandarin; Chinese listeners, in turn, boycott singers when they find out they support the Hong Kong independence movement; so on and so forth. The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement was not simply the beginning, but the result of a clash waged decades in the making.
