      The truth is, yes, mainlanders don’t get full access to any information about Hong Kong. But Hong Kong isn’t some mythical creature, only accessible through newspapers. For decades, people have travelled and worked and lived between the lands, and there is plenty of time to create their own informed, well-rounded opinion. And people loved Hong Kong. Being one of the most popular destinations within China, People come from all over the mainland to shop at Causeway Bay and eat at Dai Pai Dong food markets; on paper, there is literally no reason why Hong Kong wouldn’t be fully loved and accepted by mainland China.

      The conflict lies in the people. There are decades worth of mutual contempt and hatred that no governmental policy could mend overnight, and fueled by the protests, it has finally come to a confrontational rupture point of no return.
