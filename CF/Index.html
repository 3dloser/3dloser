<h3>the <span style="color: #E78AC3;">advancement of peace process</span> is the most common reason<br> for ceasefires</h3>
<div class="wrapper-1">
<p class="col-1">All ceasefires share the same immediate objective: <mark>to stop violence</mark>. Yet beyond this common aspiration, ceasefires are likely to vary according to their underlying purpose.</p>
<p class="p1 col-2">
  <span class="title" style="color:#E78AC3;">peace process</span>  When conflict parties associate the arrangement with tasks relating to the peaceful resolution of the dispute, including fulfilling a precondition for negotiation, signaling a desire for dialogue, or as an outcome of an ongoing negotiation.
<br><br>
  <span class="title" style="color:#8DA0CB;">humanitarian</span>Â  At the point of initiation, a conflict party associates the arrangement with the provision of life-saving or relief distributing activities such as aid delivery, vaccinations, the release of hostages, or the evacuation of civilians from specific areas.
  <br><br>
  <span class="title" style="color:#FAA243;">holiday</span>  At the point of initiation, a conflict party associates the arrangement with the celebration of some particular (typically religious) holiday, such as Christmas, Eid or Ramadan.
  <br><br>
  <span class="title" style="color:#66C2A5;">election</span>  When a ceasefire is initiated prior to, during, or following a local or national election.</p>

  <h3 class="col-3">ceasefire reasons differ across regions</h3>
  <p class = "col-4">
    While <span style="color:#E78AC3;"><b>peace process</b></span> dominates all ceasefires, 
    secondary reasons vary quite largely. <br><br>
    <b>Americas</b> is way more likely than other regions to have a ceasefire due to an <span style="color:#66C2A5;"><b>election</b></span>, 
    while the <b>Middle East</b> more often has ceasefires due to <span style="color:#8DA0CB;"><b>humanitarian</b></span> reasons. 
    At the same time, a <span style="color:#FAA243;"><b>holiday</b></span> is more likely to lead to a ceasefire in the <b>Americas</b> and <b>Asia</b>
    compared to other regions.

<p>Ultimately, the average duration of ceasefires initiated due to <span style="color:#E78AC3;"><b>peace processes</b></span> lasts much longer than that of others.</p>
